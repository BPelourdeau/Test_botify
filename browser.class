//This file describes the functioning of the class browser and especially of its methods. This method is represented her to clarify the
//script, but should be implemented in the driver of the browser.

Browser{

  //Constructor, it starts an instance of a browser
  Browser(bro)
  
  //Method to go to a certain url
  Goto(url)
  
  //Method to look for a certain item in the page and return the item
  SearchItem(id) --> item
  
  //Method to look through all the items of a certain class inside the page and return a list of these items
  SearchTheItems(class) --> [items]
  
}

Goto(url){
  //This is a function that a standard driver should have. For example, if you replace url by "www.google.com", it should navigate to
  //that page
}

SearchItem(id){
  //This function will scan the html tags of the page looking for the one with the right "id" field
  //By inspecting elements of a page in Chrome, Firefox and Edge, one can see for example that the id of the query field in google, is
  //always labeled "lst-ib" and that a result of a basic mathematical calculus is always labeled "cwos"
  //When the right item has been found, the function will return the item. (a Textbox in the case of a query filed and a String in case of
  //a simple text)
}

SearchTheItems(class){
  //It's the same as SearchItem but instead of looking for the "id" field, it will look for the right "class" field. At each element found,
  //the function will add its content to the list of [items].
  //For example, the class of the titles of the results of a research in google is always "LC201b"
}
